Hello there, and welcome to the official Vanilla Extract website repository!
### What is Vanilla Extract?
Created very recently in 2020, Vanilla Extract (or just VE) is a new Minecraft resource/data pack picker, similar to [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net). Being under construction right now, our website is not quite at the finish line yet. For now, you can visit our [temporary site](https://sites.google.com/view/vanillaextract), or our [Github links page](https://github.com/Vanilla-Extract/TempDownloadLinks/tree/main/Packs).
## A ~~brief~~ long history of Vanilla Extract
The Discord server (the start of this entire project) was created, and is still maintained by **DTRW191**, who also wrote this md! The Discord enthusiast who had recently just started the journey through the young platform originally called the Discord server the "*Melon Society*." But was joined in by **Chromus_**, who was the next person to change the  for the better, quite a bit! After gaining the trust from DTRW191, Chromus_ became the server co-owner, and technically the co-founder as well. Changing the name to "*Vanilla Extract*" by a personal request, he continued the lost purpose of the server by inviting several people who've had experience in creating packs, Mainly **Beatso**, who will later play a large part up to now on the project. Anyhow, as DTRW191 put it up on [*Disboard*](https://disboard.org), the server started to gain more traction, eventually leading the two owners to ask Beatso of a special request. To make **Extractor**, a custom Discord bot to help around with tasks similar to Beatso's own bot **Bj√∂rn**, and Vanilla Tweaks bot. Things such as its faq feature sped of explanations tenfold, and continued evolving, as more and more features came into mind (Beatso is fine right now, he ain't our personal assistant and has his own schedule, helping others out too). Having a mix of not only resource pack
The group of people behind Vanilla Extract are working hard to bring you our new website, made with help from the Compliance Tweaks (used to be Faithful Tweaks) team. Having both Minecraft datapacks and resource packs, Vanilla Extract aims to give people free quality packs that can be enjoyed in singleplayer, or even multiplayer. Our team is given the freedom to make packs for whomever they'd like, whenever they want, so they aren't bossed around all day being foraced to make certain packs dedicating their time just to us. People come to our [Discord](https://discord.io/vanillaextract) for help creating things, with guidance from our support team, they are leaded into the appropriate server for their problem, or given a direct answer if the problem is in our control. So many people have come and helped us become what we are today, they've contributed resource/data packs, helped the server grow, or/and more. Thank you, and we hope you'll be the next one to join us, whether a contributor or a sidewatcher, you are a big help!
