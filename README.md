An open source recreation of Vanilla Tweaks for the communities creations by the Vanilla Extract Team!
The group of people behind Vanilla Extract are working hard to bring you our new website, made with help from the Compliance Tweaks (used to be Faithful Tweaks) team. Having both Minecraft datapacks and resource packs, Vanilla Extract aims to give people free quality packs that can be enjoyed in singleplayer, or even multiplayer. Our team is given the freedom to make packs for whomever they'd like, whenever they want, so they aren't bossed around all day being foraced to make certain packs dedicating their time just to us. People come to our [Discord](https://discord.io/vanillaextract) for help creating things, with guidance from our support team, they are leaded into the appropriate server for their problem, or given a direct answer if the problem is in our control. So many people have come and helped us become what we are today, they've contributed resource/data packs, helped the server grow, or/and more. Thank you, and we hope you'll be the next one to join us, whether a contributor or a sidewatcher, you are a big help!
